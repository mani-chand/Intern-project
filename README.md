Hello sir/madam,This project given given by you is to build a item cart page where we can chekout with needed items by giving address while checkout.At frist what i 
thought was to build both backend and frontend with signup and signin function with a cart page.
As per the job description i thought it was mainly focused on nodejs i.e backend so designed as i designed mainly focused on backend logic and frontend react-redux part.
I havent done any UI/UX part due to time constraint.
The code which i submitted is done by my own by reference of internet and of my learning projects.
